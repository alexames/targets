Targets provides modern CMake build abstractions with Bazel-like ergonomics.

To use Targets in your CMake project:

    find_package(Targets CONFIG REQUIRED)
    include(Targets)

Then define your build targets:

    cpp_library(
        TARGET MyLib
        SOURCES src/mylib.cpp
        HEADERS include/mylib.h
        INCLUDES
            PUBLIC include/
        DEPENDENCIES
            PUBLIC fmt::fmt
    )

    cpp_binary(
        TARGET MyApp
        SOURCES src/main.cpp
        DEPENDENCIES
            PRIVATE MyLib
    )

Available functions:
  - cpp_library()    : Define a C++ library
  - cpp_binary()     : Define a C++ executable
  - cpp_test()       : Define a C++ test (requires Google Test)
  - flatbuffer_cpp_library() : Generate C++ from FlatBuffers schemas
